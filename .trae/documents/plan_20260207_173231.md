I will update the layout of the landing page sections to match the provided mobile view images, ensuring full responsiveness.

### **Plan of Action**

1.  **Hero Section (`components/Hero.tsx`)**
    *   **Layout**: Change to `flex-col-reverse md:flex-row` to place the Cube visualization above the text on mobile.
    *   **Alignment**: Center-align text and elements for mobile, reverting to left-alignment on desktop.
    *   **Spacing**: Adjust margins and paddings for mobile screens.

2.  **Features Section (`components/Features.tsx`)**
    *   **Layout**: Change to `flex-col-reverse md:flex-row` to place the Phone mockups above the "GOD'S EYE VIEW" text on mobile.
    *   **Alignment**: Center-align the heading, list items, and description for mobile.
    *   **Styling**: Ensure the list items (arrows + text) are centered and properly spaced on smaller screens.

3.  **Background Section (`components/Background.tsx`)**
    *   **Alignment**: Center-align the "BACKGROUND" heading and the "Contact Us" button on mobile.
    *   **Typography**: Adjust text alignment (likely centered or justified) for the paragraph on mobile.

4.  **Contact Section (`components/Contact.tsx`)**
    *   **Layout**: Confirm `grid-cols-1` for mobile inputs (already present, will verify).
    *   **Alignment**: Center-align the "CONTACT US" heading.
    *   **Elements**: Center the "Business/Consumer" toggle and the "SUBMIT" button.

5.  **Footer Section (`components/Footer.tsx`)**
    *   **Layout**: Switch to a single-column layout (`grid-cols-1`) on mobile.
    *   **Alignment**: Center-align all content (Brand, Arena links, Information links, Legal links) on mobile.
    *   **Ordering**: Ensure the Brand/Copyright section stays at the top or bottom as per the mobile design (Standard is often Brand top, but I'll check the flow. The image shows Brand top, then links. I will keep Brand top).
    *   **Copyright**: Ensure copyright text is properly positioned.

6.  **Navbar (`components/Navbar.tsx`)**
    *   Ensure the Logo is properly positioned and sized for mobile.

I will proceed section by section to implement these responsive updates.
